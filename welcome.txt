        SSA Retirement Benefit Estimator
================================================

Welcome to the SSA Retirement Benefit Estimator!

  This program will ask you for 2 things:
      1) Your date of birth (MM/DD/YYYY)
      2) Your SSA 'Primary Insurance Amount'

  In return, you will receive a printout of all
  possible benefit amounts depending on your
  chosen month of filing.

  You can use this benefit estimate printout to
  help you decide what may be the best month
  to start your SSA Retirement Benefits.
