# SSA Retirement Benefit Estimator

Welcome to the SSA Retirement Benefit Estimator program!

This program asks the user for their date of birth and
their estimated Full Retirement Age benefit (according
to the Social Security Administration).

In return, the user receives a printout of all possible
monthly benefit amounts depending on when they file
for benefits.

Run this command line program in the bash with:
$ python3 Retirement.py welcome.txt

I'm a newbie to Python and programming in general, so
many improvements will be made as time passes.
